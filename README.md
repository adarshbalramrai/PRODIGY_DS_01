# PRODIGY_DS_01
The "Population Demographics Visualization" project offers a comprehensive exploration of demographic distributions using Python. Leveraging synthetic data generation techniques, the project creates a dataset encapsulating both age and gender variables. Ages are randomly generated integers between 18 and 80, while genders are assigned as 'Male' or 'Female' through random selection. With the help of the pandas library, the data is organized into a DataFrame, enabling efficient manipulation and analysis. The project then utilizes the matplotlib library to craft two insightful visualizations: a histogram illustrating the distribution of ages across the population and a bar chart showcasing the gender distribution. Users can seamlessly interact with the project by running the provided Python script, with the flexibility to adjust the dataset size as per their requirements. No additional dependencies beyond Python 3.x, pandas, and matplotlib are necessary, ensuring straightforward execution. Future iterations may incorporate additional demographic variables, such as location or income, to further enrich the analysis and provide deeper insights into population dynamics.
